       <t>This document specifies the use of an RFC 3339 UTC timestamp in a
       CCNx Name as a version identifier.  It specifies a new Name segment
       label and a TLV encoding.  The use of a timestamp in a Name to denote
       a version is limited to clock synchronization and in general should
       not be used to compare versions between multiple publishers.</t>
       
      <t>Packets are represented as 32-bit wide words using ASCII art.  Because
      of the TLV encoding and optional fields or sizes, there is no concise
      way to represent all possibilities.  We use the convention that ASCII art
      fields enclosed by vertical bars "|" represent exact bit widths.  Fields
      with a forward slash "/" are variable bitwidths, which we typically pad
      out to word alignment for picture readability.</t>

    <section anchor="protocol" title="Protocol Description">
      <t>A timestamp in a CCNx Name name segment indicates an ordering on names based
      on the UTC timestamp.  The timestamp is encoded as an RFC3339 UTC string in the Interest date/time format, for example
      "1985-04-12T23:20:50.52Z". This format allows a direct strcmp() of two strings to 
      determine their time ordering. Note that we allow fractions of a second.</t>   
      <t>An example Name using this format is "lci:/Name=parc/Name=presentation.pdf/Time=1985-04-12T23:20:50.52Z".</t>
      
      <t>A publisher assigns a timestamp to indicate the time ordering of the prior Name
      name segments.  It does not imply any specific temporal meaning such as the time of content creation
      or the time of Content Object signature.  It is simply used 
      to order a set of objects. </t>
      
      <t>A "GONE" PayloadType means that this version is a terminal version.  All prior
      versions should be interpreted as deleted.  A user, however, may publish more "DATA"
      after the terminal version, if he decides to un-delete it.</t>

    <!-- References split into informative and normative -->

    <!-- There are 2 ways to insert reference entries from the citation libraries:
    1. define an ENTITY at the top, and use "ampersand character"RFC2629; here (as shown)
    2. simply use a PI "less than character"?rfc include="reference.RFC.2119.xml"?> here
       (for I-Ds: include="reference.I-D.narten-iana-considerations-rfc2434bis.xml")

    Both are cited textually in the same manner: by using xref elements.
    If you use the PI option, xml2rfc will, by default, try to find included files in the same
    directory as the including file. You can also define the XML_LIBRARY environment variable
    with a value containing a set of directories to search.  These can be either in the local
    filing system or remote ones accessed by http (http://domain/dir/... ).-->
