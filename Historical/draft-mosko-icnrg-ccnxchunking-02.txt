Internet-Draft                CCNx chunking                     May 2016


1.  Introduction

   CCNx Content Objects [CCNSemantics] are sized to amortize
   cryptographic operations over user data while simultaneously staying
   a reasonable size for transport over today's networks.  This means a
   Content Object is usually within common UDP or jumbo Ethernet size.
   If a publisher has a larger amount of data to associate with a single
   Name, the data should be chunked with this chunking protocol.  This
   protocol uses state in the Name and in an optional field within the
   Content Object.  A chunked object may also have an external metadata
   content object that describes the original pre-chunked object.

   CCNx uses two types of messages: Interests and Content Objects
   [CCNSemantics].  An Interest carries the hierarchically structured
   variable-length identifier (HSVLI), or Name, of a Content Object and
   serves as a request for that object.  If a network element sees
   multiple Interests for the same name, it may aggregate those
   Interests.  A network element along the path of the Interest with a
   matching Content Object may return that object, satisfying the
   Interest.  The Content Object follows the reverse path of the
   Interest to the origin(s) of the Interest.  A Content Object contains
   the Name, the object's Payload, and the cryptographic information
   used to bind the Name to the payload.

   This specification adds a new segment to the Name TLV and a new field
   to the Metadata TLV.  It updates [CCNMessages].  It also provides
   guidelines for the usage of the Key Locator in chunked objects.

   Packets are represented as 32-bit wide words using ASCII art.
   Because of the TLV encoding and optional fields or sizes, there is no
   concise way to represent all possibilities.  We use the convention
   that ASCII art fields enclosed by vertical bars "|" represent exact
   bit widths.  Fields with a forward slash "/" are variable bitwidths,
   which we typically pad out to word alignment for picture readability.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2.  Chunking

   Chunking, as used in this specification, means serializing user data
   into one or more chunks, each encapsulated in a CCNx Content Object.
   One segment in the Name of that Content Object represents the current
   chunk number.  A field in the Content Object's Metadata - only
   mandatory in the final chunk - represents the end of the stream.
   Chunks are denoted by a serial counter, beginning at 0 and
   incrementing by 1 for each contiguous chunk.  The chunking ends at
   the final chunk.  No valid user data exists beyond the final chunk,
   and reading beyond the final chunk MUST NOT return any user data.

   Chunking MUST use a fixed block size, where only the final chunk MAY
   use a smaller block size.  This is required to allow a reader to seek
   to a specific byte offset once it knows the block size.  The
   blocksize may be inferred from the size of the first chunk of user
   data or from an external metadata content object.  The first chunk of
   user data may not be chunk 0.

   Because of the requirement for a fixed block size, including certain
   cryptographic fields in the same content objects as user data would
   throw off the ability to seek.  Therefore, it is RECOMMENDED that all
   required cryptographic data, such as public keys or key name links,
   be included in the leading chunks before the first byte of user data.
   User data SHOULD then run continuously and with the same block size
   through the remainder of the content objects.

   This draft introduces two new Name path segment TLV types.  The first
   is the ChunkNumber name segment, which indicates the serial order of
   the chunk.  The second is a Meta name segment, which indicates that
   the Content Object carries metadata information about the Name prefix
   up to but not including the Meta name segment.

   The ChunkNumber name segment is the serial order of the chunks.  It
   MUST begin at 0 and MUST be incremented by 1 for each contiguous
   chunk.  The ChunkNumber name segment is appended to the base name of
   the user data, and is usually the last name segment.

   The Meta name segment indicates that the Content Object carries
   metadata information about the name up to but not including the Meta
   name segment.  For example, the ane "ccnx:/name=foo/version=3/
   meta=chunking/version=0" names a Content Object that carries metadata
   information about how the name "ccnx:/name=foo/version=3" is chunked.

   The new Metadata field is the EndChunkNumber.  It MUST be included in
   the Content Object which is the last chunk of an object, but SHOULD
   be present at the earliest time it is known.  The value of the
   EndChunkNumber should be the network byte order value of the last

   ChunkNumber.  For example, if 3000 bytes of user data is split with a
   1200 byte block size, there will be 3 chunks: 0, 1, and 2.  The
   EndChunkNumber is 2.

   The EndChunkNumber may be updated in later Chunks to a larger value,
   as long as it has not yet reached the end.  The EndChunkNumber SHOULD
   NOT decrease.  If a publisher wishes to close a stream before
   reaching the End Chunk, it should publish empty Content Objects to
   fill out to the maximum EndChunkNumber ever published.  These padding
   chunks MUST contain the true EndChunkNumber.

2.1.  Cryptographic material

   Chunk 0 SHOULD include the public key or key name link used to verify
   the chunked data.  It is RECOMMENDED to use the same key for the
   whole set of chunked data.  If a publisher uses multiple keys, then
   the public key or key name link for all keys SHOULD be in the leading
   chunks before any user data.

   The rationel for putting all cryptographic data up front is because
   the protocol requires using a fixed BlockSize for all user data to
   enable seeking in the chunked stream.  Because user data

2.2.  Examples

   Here are some examples of chunked Names using the Labeled Content
   Identifier URI scheme in human readable form (ccnx:).

   In this example, the content producer publishes a JPG that takes 4
   Chunks.  The EndChunkNumber is missing in the first content object
   (Chunk 0), but is known and included when Chunk 1 is published.  It
   is omitted in Chunk 2, then appears in Chunk 3, where it is
   mandatory.

   ccnx:/Name=parc/Name=picture.jpg/Chunk=0  --
   ccnx:/Name=parc/Name=picture.jpg/Chunk=1  EndChunkNumber=3
   ccnx:/Name=parc/Name=picture.jpg/Chunk=2  --
   ccnx:/Name=parc/Name=picture.jpg/Chunk=3  EndChunkNumber=3

   In this example, the publisher is writing an audio stream that ends
   before expected so the publisher fills empty Content Objects out to
   the maximum ChunkNumber, stating the correct EndChunkNumber.  Chunks
   4, 5, and 6 do not contain any new user data.

3.  Chunking Metadata

   Chunking metadata MAY be saved in a separate Content Object.  If
   Chunking metadata is saved it SHOULD be saved using a Meta labeled
   path chunk with the value of "chunking."

   An example name using SerialNumber versioning is "ccnx:/Name=parc/
   Name=picture.jpg/SerialNumber=1/Meta=chunking/SerialNumber=0".  This
   name means there is an object named "ccnx:/Name=parc/
   Name=picture.jpg/SerialNumber=1" that conforms to the Chunking
   protocol.  The chunking metadata is stored in a separate Content
   Object with the example name.

   The Chunking Metadata is a JSON Content Object whose content adheres
   to the following schema.  The BlockSize is used for all Chunks of
   user data except the last.  The EndChunkNumber is optional at the
   time the header is written, if it is not known.  Once a chunking is
   finished a new header could be written with the correct EndChunk.

   The optional Digest key is over the entire user contents.  It must
   specify the algorithm used for the digest in OID form and express the
   digest in Hexadecimal.

   The TotalBytes field is the total user bytes, if known.  If it is
   only known at a later time, the metadata object may be updated with a
   new SerialNumber when the value is known.

   The metadata content object MUST have the same KeyId -- and be signed
   by the same key -- as the Content Object to which it refers.  In the
   specific case of chunked data, the metadata object MUST be signed by
   the same key as chunk 0.

   Because the first few chunks may include cryptographic data, the
   field FirstDataChunk includes the chunk number of byte 0 of the user
   data.  All subsequent chunks contain the serialized data using
   BlockSize.

{ "chunking" :
  { "BlockSize"  : <blocksize>
    [, "FileName"   : <original file name, if known>]
    [, "EndChunkNumber" : <end Chunk, if known>]
    [, "FirstDataChunk": <chunk number for first user data chunk>]
    [, "TotalBytes" : <total bytes of all Chunks, if known>]
    [, "Digest"   : { "ALGORITHM"=<OID>, "DIGEST"=<hexadecimal value> }]
  }
}

4.  TLV Types

   This section specifies the TLV types used by CCNx chunking.

4.1.  Name Types

   CCNx chunking uses two new Name types: Chunk Number and Chunk
   Metadata.

   +--------+---------+-----------------+------------------------------+
   |  Type  |  Abbrev |       Name      | Description                  |

7.  Security Considerations

   This draft introduces a side-by-side Content Object for holding
   metadata.  The metadata Content Object for the base name "ccnx:/
   name=foo" is "ccnx:/name=foo/Meta=chunking" and the chunked user data
   is in Content Objects named "ccnx:/name=foo/ChunkNumber=N".  To
   ensure that the metadata was published by the same author as the
   chunked data, this draft REQUIRES that the KeyId fields of Chunk 0
   and the Metadata be the same and they are signed by the same key.

   This draft does not put any requirements on how chunked data is
   signed or validated.  It is RECOMMENDED
