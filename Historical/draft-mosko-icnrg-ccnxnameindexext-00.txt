                   draft-mosko-icnrg-nameindexext-00

Abstract

   A CCNx Name is a TLV encoded sequence of segments.  This document
   specifies two optional mechanisms to enable rapid access to segments
   of a CCNx Name: one provides a set of indices mapped to each Name
   segment; the other provides a single index to the chunk number
   segment of a CCNx Name.

Internet-Draft                  CCNx TLV                      March 2015


1.  Introduction

   A CCNx Name is a TLV encoded sequence of segments.  This document
   specifies two optional mechanisms to enable rapid access to segments
   of a CCNx Name: one provides a set of indices mapped to each Name
   segment; the other provides a single index to the chunk number
   segment of a CCNx Name.

   Packets are represented as 32-bit wide words using ASCII art.
   Because of the TLV encoding and optional fields or sizes, there is no
   concise way to represent all possibilities.  We use the convention
   that ASCII art fields enclosed by vertical bars "|" represent exact
   bit widths.  Fields with a forward slash "/" are variable bitwidths,
   which we typically pad out to word alignment for picture readability.

   TODO -- we have not adopted the Requirements Language yet.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2.  Protocol Description

   There are two additional CCNx Message Types covered in this document:

   +--------+----------------+-----------------+-----------------------+
   |  Type  |     Abbrev     |       Name      | Description           |
   +--------+----------------+-----------------+-----------------------+
   | %x0009 |  T_NAMEOFFSETS |   Name Segment  | The offsets into the  |
   |        |                |     Offsets     | Name TLV for each     |
   |        |                |  (Section 2.1)  | Name segment.         |
   |        |                |                 |                       |
   | %x000A | T_CHUNKOFFSETS |    Chunk Name   | The offset into the   |
   |        |                |  Segment Offset | Name TLV for the      |
   |        |                |  (Section 2.2)  | Chunk number segment. |
   +--------+----------------+-----------------+-----------------------+

                  Table 1: Additional CCNx Message Types

   These message TLVs SHOULD directly follow the Name TLV in the CCNx
   Message.

2.1.  Name Segment Offsets

   A CCNx Name is a TLV encoded sequence of segments.  The Name Segment
   Offsets TLV comprises a set of 2 byte offsets into the Name TLV, each
   jumping directly to a Name segment.  The first segment (offset 0) is
   assumed and NOT included.

   For example, given the CCNx Name TLV:

                        1                   2                   3
    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
   +---------------+---------------+---------------+---------------+
   |            (T_NAME)           |           %x14 (20)           |
   +---------------+---------------+---------------+---------------+
   |        (T_NAME_SEGMENT)       |           %x03 (3)            |
   +---------------+---------------+---------------+---------------+
   |       f                o               o      |(T_NAME_SEGMENT)
   +---------------+---------------+---------------+---------------+
   |               |            %x03 (3)           |       b       |
   +---------------+---------------+---------------+---------------+
   |      a                r       |           (T_NAME_SEMGMENT)   |
   +---------------+---------------+---------------+---------------+
   |           %x02 (2)            |        y      |       o       |
   +---------------+---------------+---------------+---------------+
   |           (T_CHUNK)           |           %x02 (2)            |
   +---------------+---------------+---------------+---------------+
   |              29               /

   +---------------+---------------+

   the Name Segment Offset TLV would look be:

                        1                   2                   3
    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
   +---------------+---------------+---------------+---------------+
   |         (T_NAME_OFFSETS)      |           %x06 (6)            |
   +---------------+---------------+---------------+---------------+
   |               7               |              14               |
   +---------------+---------------+---------------+---------------+
   |              20               |
   +---------------+---------------+

   The first segment starts at offset 0 and is not included; the second
   T_NAME_SEGMENT with value "bar" starts at offset 7; the third
   T_NAME_SEGMENT with value "yo" starts at offset 14; and the last
   segment - a T_CHUNK segment - starts at offset 20.

2.2.  Chunk Name Segment Offset

   The Chunk Name Segment Offset provides the index to the T_CHUNK
   segment of a CCNx Name.  In the above example, this TLV would look
   like:

                        1                   2                   3
    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
   +---------------+---------------+---------------+---------------+
   |         (T_CHUNK_OFFSET)      |           %x02 (2)            |
   +---------------+---------------+---------------+---------------+
   |               20              |
   +---------------+---------------+

4.  IANA Considerations

   TODO: Work with IANA to define the type space for CCNx messages
   types.

   All drafts are required to have an IANA considerations section (see
   Guidelines for Writing an IANA Considerations Section in RFCs
   [RFC5226] for a guide).  If the draft does not require IANA to do
   anything, the section contains an explicit statement that this is the
   case (as above).  If there are no requirements for IANA, the section
   will be removed during conversion into an RFC by the RFC Editor.
