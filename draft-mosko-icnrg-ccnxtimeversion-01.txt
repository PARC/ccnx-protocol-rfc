1.  Introduction

   This document specifies the use of an RFC 3339 UTC timestamp in a
   CCNx Name as a version identifier.  It specifies a new Name segment
   label and a TLV encoding.  The use of a timestamp in a Name to denote
   a version is limited to clock synchronization and in general should
   not be used to compare versions between multiple publishers.

   Packets are represented as 32-bit wide words using ASCII art.
   Because of the TLV encoding and optional fields or sizes, there is no
   concise way to represent all possibilities.  We use the convention
   that ASCII art fields enclosed by vertical bars "|" represent exact
   bit widths.  Fields with a forward slash "/" are variable bitwidths,
   which we typically pad out to word alignment for picture readability.

   TODO -- we have not adopted the Requirements Language yet.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2.  Protocol Description

   A timestamp in a CCNx Name name segment indicates an ordering on
   names based on the UTC timestamp.  The timestamp is encoded as an
   RFC3339 UTC string in the Interest date/time format, for example
   "1985-04-12T23:20:50.52Z".  This format allows a direct strcmp() of
   two strings to determine their time ordering.  Note that we allow
   fractions of a second.

   An example Name using this format is "lci:/Name=parc/
   Name=presentation.pdf/Time=1985-04-12T23:20:50.52Z".

   A publisher assigns a timestamp to indicate the time ordering of the
   prior Name name segments.  It does not imply any specific temporal
   meaning such as the time of content creation or the time of Content
   Object signature.  It is simply used to order a set of objects.

   A "GONE" PayloadType means that this version is a terminal version.
   All prior versions should be interpreted as deleted.  A user,
   however, may publish more "DATA" after the terminal version, if he
   decides to un-delete it.

4.  IANA Considerations

   This memo includes no request to IANA.

   All drafts are required to have an IANA considerations section (see
   Guidelines for Writing an IANA Considerations Section in RFCs
   [RFC5226] for a guide).  If the draft does not require IANA to do
   anything, the section contains an explicit statement that this is the
   case (as above).  If there are no requirements for IANA, the section
   will be removed during conversion into an RFC by the RFC Editor.

5.  Security Considerations

   All drafts are required to have a security considerations section.
   See RFC 3552 [RFC3552] for a guide.
