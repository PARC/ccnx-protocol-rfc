    <h1>What is CCNx?</h1>
    <p>
        The vision of CCNx is to develop, promote, and evaluate a new approach to a communication
        architecture called content-centric networking. We seek to carry out this mission by creating
        and publishing open protocol specifications and a software reference implementation of those
        protocols. We provide support for a community of people interested in experimentation, research,
        and commercialization of this technology.
    </p>

    <p>
        See the ICNRG IRTF group for more information about this field as a whole.
    </p>

    <h1>Specifications</h1>
    <p>
        The CCNx protocol is detailed in the following specification documents:
        <ul>
            <li><a href="/ccnx-spec/documents/messages.html">CCNx Messages in TLV Format</a></li>
            <li><a href="/ccnx-spec/documents/semantics.html">CCNx Semantics</a></li>
            <li><a href="/ccnx-spec/documents/names.html">CCNx URI Scheme</a></li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <h1>Participation</h1>
    <p>
        You can participate by joining the ICNRG and CCNx mailing lists
        and attending any of the meetings.

        The CCNx protocol is driven by the Palo Alto Research Center (PARC) and is
        based upon the PARC Content-Centric Networking (CCN) architecture, which is the
        focus of a major, long-term research and development program. There are
        interesting problems in many areas still to be solved to fully realize and apply
        the vision, but we believe that enough of an architectural foundation is in
        place to enable significant experiments to begin. Since this new approach to
        networking can be deployed through middleware software communicating in an
        overlay on existing networks, it is possible to start applying it now to solve
        communication problems in new ways. CCNx is an invitation to join us and participate
        in this exploration of the frontier of content networking.
