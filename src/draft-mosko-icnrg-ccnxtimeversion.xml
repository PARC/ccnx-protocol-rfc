    <section anchor="protocol" title="Protocol Description">
      <t>A timestamp in a CCNx Name name segment indicates an ordering on names based
        on the UTC timestamp.  The timestamp is encoded as an RFC3339 UTC 
        string in the 'date-time' format, for example
        "1985-04-12T23:20:50.52Z". This format allows a memcmp() of two strings to 
        determine their time ordering (see <xref target="Comparing"/>). </t>
      
      <t>The timestamp MUST use the format of RFC 3339 Sections 5.6-5.7 with the restriction
        that it MUST use the 'Z' UTC signifier and MUST NOT use the 'time-numoffset' format.</t>
      
      <t>The timestamp MAY have fractions of a second, as per RFC3339.  The fractions
        MUST use the '.' separator, as specified in RFC 3339 Section 5.6.  This restriction
        is to ensure that memcmp() ordering is maintained.</t>
             
       <t>The use of a timestamp in a Name to denote
        a version SHOULD NOT assume global time coordination and
        SHOULD NOT be used to denote ordering or causation between multiple
        publishers.</t>
      
      <t>If multiple publishers -- with different clocks -- write to the same
        namespace, the name SHOULD include a name segment prior to the timestamp
        that indicates the publisher.  For example, one could include the publisher's
        KeyId, or any globally unique string between the publishers.</t>
      
      <t>A name segment timestamp MUST use the UTC 'Z' notation, not a '+' or '-' offset
        (the 'time-numoffset' token in RFC 3339).
        This restriction is to ensure that timestamps may be ordered simply by a direct comparison
        (see <xref target="Comparing"/>).</t>
      
      <t>An example Name using this format is 
        "ccnx:/Name=parc/Name=file.pdf/Time=1985-04-12T23:20:50.52Z".</t>
      
      <t>A publisher assigns a timestamp to indicate the time ordering of the prior Name
      name segments.  It does not imply any specific temporal meaning such as the time of content creation
        or the time of Content Object signature.  It is simply used to order a set of objects. 
        An application MAY adopt such a semantic to the timestamp as an
      application-specific specification.</t>

    <section anchor="Comparing" title="Comparing timestamps">
      <t>The TLV length of the timestamp MUST be at least 20 octets to be compliant
         with RFC 3339, and thus with this specification.</t>
      
      <t>As per RFC 3339, the string format for two timestamps MAY be compared via
        memcmp() up to the minimum string length minus 1 (to trim the terminal 'Z').
        If the two timestamps are equal, up to
        the minimum length, then the shorter string is less than the longer string.
        Because we require UTC time zone with the 'Z' notation, the only time two strings
        may be of different lengths is when one includes milliseconds, so the
        rule here is correct.</t>

    <section anchor="Security" title="Security Considerations">
      <t>An entity parsing a T_TIME name segment is not required to parse the segment
        for validity in formatting to only compute ordering.  Because the format allows
        a direct memcmp() and
        the length of the string is available via the TLV length, there should be no
        vulnerability to mis-formatted values.  Other uses of the timestamp should
        ensure the format conforms to RFC 3339 'Z' format.</t>

    Both are cited textually in the same manner: by using xref elements.
    If you use the PI option, xml2rfc will, by default, try to find included files in the same
    directory as the including file. You can also define the XML_LIBRARY environment variable
    with a value containing a set of directories to search.  These can be either in the local
    filing system or remote ones accessed by http (http://domain/dir/... ).-->
