<h1><br />The CCNx URI Scheme<br />draft-mosko-icnrg-ccnxurischeme-00</h1>

<h3>Abstract</h3>

<p>
        This document defines an RFC3986 URI compliant identifier called a Labeled
        Segment URI in which name segments carry a label. This allows differentiation
        between unrelated resources with similar identifiers. This document also
        specifies the CCNx URI scheme, called "ccnx:," which conforms to the
        labeled segment encoding rules presented here. The CCNx URI scheme
        applies specific labels to each name segment of a URI to disambiguate between
        resources with similar names. This document defines a specific set of
        segment labels with label semantics.
