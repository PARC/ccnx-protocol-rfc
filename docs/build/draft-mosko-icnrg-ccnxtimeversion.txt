1.  Introduction

   This document specifies the use of a subset of RFC 3339 [RFC3339] UTC
   timestamp in a CCNx Name as a version identifier.  We restrict the
   use of RFC 3339 to only using UTC time with the 'Z' notation, not
   relative offsets from UTC.

   This document updates CCNx Messages in TLV Format [CCNMessages].  It
   introduces a new CCNx Name Segment TLV type.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2.  Protocol Description

   A timestamp in a CCNx Name name segment indicates an ordering on
   names based on the UTC timestamp.  The timestamp is encoded as an
   RFC3339 UTC string in the 'date-time' format, for example
   "1985-04-12T23:20:50.52Z".  This format allows a memcmp() of two
   strings to determine their time ordering (see Section 3).

   The timestamp MUST use the format of RFC 3339 Sections 5.6-5.7 with
   the restriction that it MUST use the 'Z' UTC signifier and MUST NOT
   use the 'time-numoffset' format.

   The timestamp MAY have fractions of a second, as per RFC3339.  The
   fractions MUST use the '.' separator, as specified in RFC 3339
   Section 5.6.  This restriction is to ensure that memcmp() ordering is
   maintained.

   The use of a timestamp in a Name to denote a version SHOULD NOT
   assume global time coordination and SHOULD NOT be used to denote
   ordering or causation between multiple publishers.

   If multiple publishers -- with different clocks -- write to the same
   namespace, the name SHOULD include a name segment prior to the
   timestamp that indicates the publisher.  For example, one could
   include the publisher's KeyId, or any globally unique string between
   the publishers.

   A name segment timestamp MUST use the UTC 'Z' notation, not a '+' or
   '-' offset (the 'time-numoffset' token in RFC 3339).  This
   restriction is to ensure that timestamps may be ordered simply by a
   direct comparison (see Section 3).

   An example Name using this format is "ccnx:/Name=parc/Name=file.pdf/
   Time=1985-04-12T23:20:50.52Z".

   A publisher assigns a timestamp to indicate the time ordering of the
   prior Name name segments.  It does not imply any specific temporal
   meaning such as the time of content creation or the time of Content
   Object signature.  It is simply used to order a set of objects.  An
   application MAY adopt such a semantic to the timestamp as an
   application-specific specification.

3.  Comparing timestamps

   The TLV length of the timestamp MUST be at least 20 octets to be
   compliant with RFC 3339, and thus with this specification.

   As per RFC 3339, the string format for two timestamps MAY be compared
   via memcmp() up to the minimum string length minus 1 (to trim the
   terminal 'Z').  If the two timestamps are equal, up to the minimum
   length, then the shorter string is less than the longer string.
   Because we require UTC time zone with the 'Z' notation, the only time
   two strings may be of different lengths is when one includes
   milliseconds, so the rule here is correct.

4.  Acknowledgements

5.  IANA Considerations

   This memo includes no request to IANA.

   This draft introduces a new value in the CCNx Name Segment type
   registry.

6.  Security Considerations

   An entity parsing a T_TIME name segment is not required to parse the
   segment for validity in formatting to only compute ordering.  Because
   the format allows a direct memcmp() and the length of the string is
   available via the TLV length, there should be no vulnerability to
   mis-formatted values.  Other uses of the timestamp should ensure the
   format conforms to RFC 3339 'Z' format.
